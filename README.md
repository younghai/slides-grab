<p align="center">Select context for agents directly from AI-generated HTML slides</p>

<p align="center">
How? Just drag an area in the slides and ask the agent to edit it.<br>
Simple things like text, size, or bold can still be edited manually, just like in the 2024 era.
</p>

<p align="center">
The whole slides are HTML & CSS, the programming langauge (which is not) that outperformed by AI agents.<br>
So the slides are beautiful, easily editable by AI agents, and can be converted to PDF or to experimental / unstable PPTX formats.
</p>

<p align="center">
The editor is pure javascript file. You can easily add up new features like adding new coding agents, changing designs, etc.

## Quick Start

Paste one of these into your coding agent:

**Claude Code:**

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkehfdl1/slides-grab/main/docs/prompts/setup-claude.md and follow every step.
```

**Codex:**

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkehfdl1/slides-grab/main/docs/prompts/setup-codex.md and follow every step.
```

Or clone manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vkehfdl1/slides-grab.git && cd slides-grab
npm ci && npx playwright install chromium
```

> Requires **Node.js >= 18**.

## Why This Project?

There are many AI tools that generate slide HTML. Almost none let you **visually point at what you want changed** and iterate in-place. slides-grab fills that gap:

- **Plan** — Agent creates a structured slide outline from your topic/files
- **Design** — Agent generates each slide as a self-contained HTML file
- **Edit** — Browser-based editor with bbox selection, direct text editing, and agent-powered rewrites
- **Export** — One command to PDF, plus experimental / unstable PPTX or Figma-export flows

## CLI Commands

All commands support `--slides-dir <path>` (default: `slides`).

On a fresh clone, only `--help`, `list-templates`, and `list-themes` work without a deck. `edit`, `build-viewer`, `validate`, `convert`, and `pdf` require an existing slides workspace containing `slide-*.html`.

```bash
slides-grab edit              # Launch visual slide editor
slides-grab build-viewer      # Build single-file viewer.html
slides-grab validate          # Validate slide HTML (Playwright-based)
slides-grab convert           # Export to experimental / unstable PPTX
slides-grab convert --resolution 2160p  # Higher-resolution raster PPTX export
slides-grab figma             # Export an experimental / unstable Figma Slides importable PPTX
slides-grab pdf               # Export PDF in capture mode (default)
slides-grab pdf --resolution 2160p  # Higher-resolution image-backed PDF export
slides-grab pdf --mode print  # Export searchable/selectable text PDF
slides-grab list-templates    # Show available slide templates
slides-grab list-themes       # Show available color themes
```

## Image Contract

Slides should store local image files in `<slides-dir>/assets/` and reference them as `./assets/<file>` from each `slide-XX.html`.

- Preferred: `<img src="./assets/example.png" alt="...">`
- Allowed: `data:` URLs for fully self-contained slides
- Allowed with warnings: remote `https://` images
- Unsupported: absolute filesystem paths such as `/Users/...` or `C:\\...`

Run `slides-grab validate --slides-dir <path>` before export to catch missing local assets and discouraged path forms.

`slides-grab pdf` now defaults to `--mode capture`, which rasterizes each rendered slide into the PDF for better visual fidelity. Use `--mode print` when searchable/selectable browser text matters more than pixel-perfect parity.

`slides-grab pdf` and `slides-grab convert` now default to `2160p` / `4k` raster output for sharper exports. You can still override with `--resolution <preset>` using `720p`, `1080p`, `1440p`, `2160p`, or `4k` when you want smaller or faster artifacts.

### Multi-Deck Workflow

Prerequisite: create or generate a deck in `decks/my-deck/` first.

```bash
slides-grab edit       --slides-dir decks/my-deck
slides-grab validate   --slides-dir decks/my-deck
slides-grab pdf        --slides-dir decks/my-deck --output decks/my-deck.pdf
slides-grab pdf        --slides-dir decks/my-deck --mode print --output decks/my-deck-searchable.pdf
slides-grab convert    --slides-dir decks/my-deck --output decks/my-deck.pptx
slides-grab figma      --slides-dir decks/my-deck --output decks/my-deck-figma.pptx
```

> **Warning:** `slides-grab convert` and `slides-grab figma` are currently **experimental / unstable**. Expect best-effort output, layout shifts, and manual cleanup in PowerPoint or Figma.

### Figma Workflow

```bash
slides-grab figma --slides-dir decks/my-deck --output decks/my-deck-figma.pptx
```

This command reuses the HTML to PPTX pipeline and emits a `.pptx` deck intended for manual import into Figma Slides via `Import`. It does not upload to Figma directly. The Figma export path is **experimental / unstable** and should be treated as best-effort only.
